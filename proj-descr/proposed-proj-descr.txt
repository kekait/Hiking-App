We want to make a hiking app that tracks the duration of a user's hike. It will display trail conditons,
the weather, distance. The application should keep track of the user's average walking speed to determine
how long it will take the user to walk a certain trail. The app will find trails near the user's current
location. The user should be able to add trail notes such as hazards, and things to generally look out
for. User maybe able to create their own profile(if time permits).
