Iteration 3 plan

These are the user stories we'd like to implement by our due date:

E - 3 hours - A user can leave trail notes so others will know what to expect.
F - 3 hours - A user can download a trail route so the user can view it offline.

Our iteration 2 due date has been decided on December 2nd 2016
