For acceptance testing we created a checklist of things that needed to happen for our thrid iteration to be a success

The first thing to do was to go to the website link. When there the list is as follows

1)The user is greated with a google map view of somewhere local (In this case it was of arcata).
2)There is a trails buttong and a help button visable on the top green bar.
3)The user can push the trails or help button to see a drop down.
4)The user can select a trail from the trails button and the map will find the selected trail.
5)The user can select the pin to see specific information about their selected trail.
6)The user can search for anything in the search bar and it will find it on the map.
