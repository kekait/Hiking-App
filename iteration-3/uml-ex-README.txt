Team_ISAK's UML diagram README.txt

In this diagram we have Homepage, Help, Login, Find Trail, Trail notes, available trails, search trails, and trail found
components.

1) Users make it to the home page where it sets up three actions:
   a) help
   b) login
   c) find trail

2) Help can be opened or closed on homepage

3) Loging in can lead to accessing the database to write trail notes

4) Going to find trails leads to two actions:
   a) Available trails
   b) Search Trails

5) Available trails is accessed through the trails icon

6) Search trails can be access through the search box

7) Available trails and Search trails lead to completing an aciton

8) This leads to trail found, which is the final action in the UML
