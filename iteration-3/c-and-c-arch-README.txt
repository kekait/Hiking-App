Team_ISAK's c-and-c-arch diagram

README:

For our project we created a website for people to use, which connects to a database to gather information that the user can
input and log into.

For this diagram we have Client, Application, Server, and Database components.

1) Client is connected to the Application via http, and vice versa.

2) Application is connected to the Server via http, and vice versa.

3) Finally, the Server is connected to the Database via our Oracle through the campus, and relays information back to the
   user.


Our diagram is relatively simple, because we are only gathering information from Google, like our Maps API information, and
logging in to the Oracle database on campus for user input collection and web hosting.
