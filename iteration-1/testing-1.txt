For acceptance testing we created a checklist of things that needed to happen for our first iteration to be a success


The first thing to dow as to go to the website link. When there the list is as follows

1)The user is greated with a google map view of somewhere local (In this case it was of arcata)
2)There should either be a search bar or a menu within plain site for the user
3)The user should be able to interect with the search bar or menu
4)The user should then be able to view a trail on the map
5)The user should be able to pull up information on trail easily



Testing went as follows
1)Success, but would like a view of where user was
2)Menu bar with 3 available trails. Success
3)user was able to interact easily with menu. Success
4)Success, all 3 trails worked
5)Could pull up info. Would like more info besides name and distance. Would also like
	for info to pop up on it's own or something. Success............kind of
	
	
	
	
	

	
	
For unit testing it was a bit difficult because we did not know how to test a website.
Furthermore it is built around a map application, so all parts would need to be run with the function
that creates our map instance.

So for unit testing (and honestly we were a bit unsure about how to go about it) we created a checklist.

1)map should open on load
2)menu should be ontop of map
3)menu should have buttons/search bar to get to trails
4)buttons should actually take us to trails
5) we should be able to look at any trail as many times as possible



As far as our iteration went our software passed. However we felt that perhaps we as a group did not fully
understand unit testing, so this is what we came up with.
